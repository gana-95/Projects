So unlike other strollers where you can easily pop out the snack tray and hose it off in the sink, this one stays gross &amp; you have to do your best with wet wipes.- it makes the folded configuration a little thicker- if the kids are buckled, the tray is so high they can't reach it.  (this goes with my first point)- it is soooo difficult to install &amp; one screw on mine constantly falls off so I finally just left it off.- too expensive- it's impossible for the kids to climb in.  a 2 year old &amp; 4 year old both have the same problem.  they can't go under it because humans don't twist that way (even them who can climb on anything) so my 2 year old son tries to climb over it if I don't get to him quick enough &amp; it gives me a heart attack each time I catch him trying that b/che'll fall &amp; hit his head one of these days if I don't grab him quick enough.

       "      <td>I have owned this toy twice so far. I bought one when my daughter was 6 months old and thought she would love it. She ended up not liking it at all. She was not a \"bouncy\" baby. We ended up taking it back for an exersaucer instead. Fast forward 2 years later I had my son, he just turned 6 months and he's a bouncer. The exersaucer is not his thing, I ended up buying this again. He LOVES this so much. Onto the review of the jumperoo nowLike every other baby toy it takes up room, I do like that it folds down a bit but still bulky so be prepared if you have a small apartment. It has adjustable straps to grow with baby. My son is on the number 2 setting at 6 months. 27 1/2 inches. The seat cover is easy to get off and wash which is great. Very easy to clean most parts. The toys on the jumperoo are four different spinners...lizard, sun, rainbow disk and a small one with an animal sticker. I think they could have come up with some else, four is over kill. There is a peekaboo tiger which is hard for the baby to press and it doesn't come up far enough. My son doesn't even bother with that. A musical trio which is ok the animals dont do anything except the elelphant which the baby has to turn to see its face. The lights gets the babys attention. The other toy Is a bug on a long stick...in the picture it shows standing up..our flops over so half the time it hangs off the side. I think some of the toys could be better, it would be awesome if they made a jumperoo with interchangeable toys. Especially some bigger crinkle ones..I have yet to meet a baby who doesn't like crinkles lol What I liked most and it's something that bugs me on a lot of other toys but this one doesn't have this problem is volume control. I love that it is not loud! Finally they figured out babies are not deaf.  Overall  it's a cute toy and will def give mom a break to do some dishes. I would also recommend waiting until 6 months to buy the toy it's not for all babies. If you baby is a jumper I would recommend it if not an exersaucer would do fine.</td>\n",

The best test for me was HOW it held my hair-styling in place during an outdoor concert (breezy &amp; warm) without being sticky and looking stiff or unnatural.  Wow!\\n\\nDue to aging and some thyroid issues, I've been losing quite a bit of hair.  What used to be full is currently thin in comparison.  Thankfully, I have some natural curl/wave.  Wanting my hair up (high pony tail) with softness around the bangs and face, I styled and sprayed.  Very natural (yay!) and soft looking.  I also spritzed the pony-tail curls.  After sleeping with it (in same style), I was even more impressed that the curl remaining in my pony tail the next morning.  When I took it down, my whole head of hair had more volume/hold and I could get away with no re-washing it (time crunch).\\n\\nI am \"scent sensitive\" and the Calista spray was not strong, allergy-inspiring, and any scent dissipated quickly.  My sensitive-nosed husband with whom I sat next to (in the car &amp; the concert), never said, \"what's that smell?\"... which is the TRUE test!\\n\\nI am very happy with this spray and look forward to testing it with other styling.

       "5   This monitor is fantastic. The picture is very clear, even in the dark, and the sound is super sensitive. The battery lasts a long time, and after almost 2 years of daily use it is still working perfect and we have had zero problems with it. Every once in a while we'll get a tad bit of static, but the house is pretty big, so it's expected. This was definitely worth the money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "6   So pleased with this.  My mother purchased a different kind for her house, and the quality just didn't compare.1  The single piece of molded foam makes for super easy cleaning.2  The pee guard is great to keep messes from happening.3  The design is genius.  My son clearly feels more supported and comfortable on this than other types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "8   I bought this for my little girl when she was 12 months old.  I never used exersausers much with my three older children because they were very mobile very young and crawled/walked around to different pile of toys I had laying around for them.  However, Anna wasn't so mobile, so I got this for her.SHE LOVED IT!  I didn't even ever put any batteries in it.  She would play with it for hours and loved all the toys.  It really does grow with the child.One bad thing I noticed was that ours came with a food tray that never stayed on right.  Plus, who wants food near the exersaucer?  Soft food (baby food, etc.) would get smeared all over it; hard food (cheerios, etc.) would get crushed into it and shoved into little crevasses...never did understand the food tray coming with a toy??  I don't think it was any reason to dock it a star, though.This is a great toy!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "10  Bought this and wish I had not. Have had it for three months, and my husband uses it a few times a week and when he does it easily shows any sweat once it dries. The quality is poor and the stitching is fraying / coming apart. Not impressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "12  - they are waaay too high to be useful as snack traps.- once they get gross with soggy goldfish there is no way to clean them because they stay permanently attached.  So unlike other strollers where you can easily pop out the snack tray and hose it off in the sink, this one stays gross & you have to do your best with wet wipes.- it makes the folded configuration a little thicker- if the kids are buckled, the tray is so high they can't reach it.  (this goes with my first point)- it is soooo difficult to install & one screw on mine constantly falls off so I finally just left it off.- too expensive- it's impossible for the kids to climb in.  a 2 year old & 4 year old both have the same problem.  they can't go under it because humans don't twist that way (even them who can climb on anything) so my 2 year old son tries to climb over it if I don't get to him quick enough & it gives me a heart attack each time I catch him trying that b/che'll fall & hit his head one of these days if I don't grab him quick enough.  So I have to lift my heavy 4 year old &  2 year old in EVERY TIME.  lift them in, lift them out, lift them in, lift them out.  and it's not just a short lift, you have to lift them high up and they have to contort themselves to fit under it.awful design.  Bob folks - you gotta fix this.  this design hasn't changed for years.  Change the seats so they sit straight upright and add a snack tray that will funcion as a snack tray.  I know you can do it :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "15  I have owned this toy twice so far. I bought one when my daughter was 6 months old and thought she would love it. She ended up not liking it at all. She was not a \"bouncy\" baby. We ended up taking it back for an exersaucer instead. Fast forward 2 years later I had my son, he just turned 6 months and he's a bouncer. The exersaucer is not his thing, I ended up buying this again. He LOVES this so much. Onto the review of the jumperoo nowLike every other baby toy it takes up room, I do like that it folds down a bit but still bulky so be prepared if you have a small apartment. It has adjustable straps to grow with baby. My son is on the number 2 setting at 6 months. 27 1/2 inches. The seat cover is easy to get off and wash which is great. Very easy to clean most parts. The toys on the jumperoo are four different spinners...lizard, sun, rainbow disk and a small one with an animal sticker. I think they could have come up with some else, four is over kill. There is a peekaboo tiger which is hard for the baby to press and it doesn't come up far enough. My son doesn't even bother with that. A musical trio which is ok the animals dont do anything except the elelphant which the baby has to turn to see its face. The lights gets the babys attention. The other toy Is a bug on a long stick...in the picture it shows standing up..our flops over so half the time it hangs off the side. I think some of the toys could be better, it would be awesome if they made a jumperoo with interchangeable toys. Especially some bigger crinkle ones..I have yet to meet a baby who doesn't like crinkles lol What I liked most and it's something that bugs me on a lot of other toys but this one doesn't have this problem is volume control. I love that it is not loud! Finally they figured out babies are not deaf.  Overall  it's a cute toy and will def give mom a break to do some dishes. I would also recommend waiting until 6 months to buy the toy it's not for all babies. If you baby is a jumper I would recommend it if not an exersaucer would do fine.   \n",
       "17  VERY happy with this spray with my hair.  The best test for me was HOW it held my hair-styling in place during an outdoor concert (breezy & warm) without being sticky and looking stiff or unnatural.  Wow!\\n\\nDue to aging and some thyroid issues, I've been losing quite a bit of hair.  What used to be full is currently thin in comparison.  Thankfully, I have some natural curl/wave.  Wanting my hair up (high pony tail) with softness around the bangs and face, I styled and sprayed.  Very natural (yay!) and soft looking.  I also spritzed the pony-tail curls.  After sleeping with it (in same style), I was even more impressed that the curl remaining in my pony tail the next morning.  When I took it down, my whole head of hair had more volume/hold and I could get away with no re-washing it (time crunch).\\n\\nI am \"scent sensitive\" and the Calista spray was not strong, allergy-inspiring, and any scent dissipated quickly.  My sensitive-nosed husband with whom I sat next to (in the car & the concert), never said, \"what's that smell?\"... which is the TRUE test!\\n\\nI am very happy with this spray and look forward to testing it with other styling.  A little goes a long way, so I'm encouraged the price will equal its value.  Fun!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "19  My baby first started using this activity center at around 5-6 months old. He's in the 90th percentile for height, but his legs still dangled from the lowest setting. He's a pretty passive baby and basically sat there for the first 2 months, randomly leaning on music buttons. Now that he's a bit older, he enjoys it much more, but not as much as the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn at daycare. If you have a very energetic and tall baby, you would probably do well with this bouncer. But there's honestly better activity centers out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

We live at 7,000ft so not in a warm climate by any means - houses where we live don't even have AC.  I could not imagine how much he'd sweat in a warm or humid climate.  Even after short rides in a well ventilated cool car his head totally soaks the head rest and the back of his shirt is totally soaked through.  Going to look at other options for our next baby as our son loves his car seat and going for rides until he is soaking in sweat.</td>\n",

The seat is much lighter than many of the others we looked at but still sturdy. The seat is not bulky at all and leaves enough room for our older 2 to be able to buckle their seat belts in the backseat! The seat comes with an insert over the back to pad around babies head as well as a guard over the feet. Both of these are removable as baby grows. With our other kids we had to go out and get special inserts to go around the baby's head to keep them snug in their seats. No need here! This seat is designed for the safety of newborns. But again, you can remove the extra pieces for more space later when baby has more head control. The latches are a little pesky - you have to line up the two sides together before latching them into the center piece. But after a few tries you get the hang of it. It's very easy to adjust the straps with the slack and a release button located at the front of the seat. Love the base. Seat snaps in and out very easily and it's easy to belt into the car.Overall we're happy with the safety ratings, the design, especially the weight and ease of use, and we would recommend this seat!</td>\n",

       "      <td>First, we love this stroller... Second, we love this travel system... Third, I figured out how to make the travel system even better for the early months when the baby isn't big enough to use the actual stroller alone and when mom is still recovering from child birth and every extra pound makes a difference when lifting.Here's what I did, I took the seat completely off the stroller and used the frame as a snap and go for the carseat.  The seat is connected with velcro and a few snaps.  The hardest part was taking the quick release handle off because it uses a keyring type of connection, but with a little work it comes off just fine.  The entire process of taking the seat off took 10mins or less.  Putting the seat back on took about the same time or just a little longer since I made sure I put it on correctly.This was awesome for many reasons:1. The carseat still snapped into the frame with no problems, because the clips are connected directly to the frame2. The stroller is lighter (at least a pound or two)!  This made a huge difference for me being able to lift it in and out of the car3. The basket underneath is so much more useful. You can throw a huge bag in there because the seat is no longer in the way.  We were also able to put folding chairs over the basket for a day in the park and the stroller held up great4. Takes up less space in the trunk because the middle of the folded stroller is now a space you can put other things (instead of putting things on top of the seat that was there)We have since put the seat back on the stroller because the baby is now able to use the stroller without the carseat, but consider this option for the early months.  It saves you the money of buying a snap and go if you were considering that.  Also, this way is much sturdier than a snap and go, because you still get all the great features of the B-Agile including its quick fold.Happy Strolling!!!</td>\n",

       "38   The chicco car seats are great - easy to use, high safety ratings, and nice looking.  My only complaint about this car seat is that my son sweats like crazy in it.  We live at 7,000ft so not in a warm climate by any means - houses where we live don't even have AC.  I could not imagine how much he'd sweat in a warm or humid climate.  Even after short rides in a well ventilated cool car his head totally soaks the head rest and the back of his shirt is totally soaked through.  Going to look at other options for our next baby as our son loves his car seat and going for rides until he is soaking in sweat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "85   It doesn't really keep the car seat cool, but it does keep it cooler than the rest of the car, which is noticeable when you are in very hot temperatures.  We traveled through areas with 3 digit temperatures (Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, Southern California, etc). The most important part is that the metal parts of the buckles don't get hot enough to burn the baby, and this is what it did.  For the price, great product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "96   You can't put a price on your child's safety, but $60 plus for the car seat base it a little ridiculous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "124  This works great to entertain my 3 month old who gets fussy if the car seat isn't moving!  It helps to keep him happy while I'm trying to pack up the car and get him situated.  It's great for those down times when the car isn't moving yet.The only thing I do wish it had was an option to have it stay on for a few minutes.  He's too little to hit the button himself to play the noises and lights so I have to hit the button and I can't safely do that from the front seat while we are driving!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "148  We got this seat in Pink Mist at Target. It's awesome. The handle and overall shape is great, very easy to carry and move around. The seat is much lighter than many of the others we looked at but still sturdy. The seat is not bulky at all and leaves enough room for our older 2 to be able to buckle their seat belts in the backseat! The seat comes with an insert over the back to pad around babies head as well as a guard over the feet. Both of these are removable as baby grows. With our other kids we had to go out and get special inserts to go around the baby's head to keep them snug in their seats. No need here! This seat is designed for the safety of newborns. But again, you can remove the extra pieces for more space later when baby has more head control. The latches are a little pesky - you have to line up the two sides together before latching them into the center piece. But after a few tries you get the hang of it. It's very easy to adjust the straps with the slack and a release button located at the front of the seat. Love the base. Seat snaps in and out very easily and it's easy to belt into the car.Overall we're happy with the safety ratings, the design, especially the weight and ease of use, and we would recommend this seat!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "154  I have been using this stroller for about a year for walks around the neighborhood, trips to the zoo, and parks. It is great on paved surfaces and packed sand/dirt park trails.

       "181  First, we love this stroller... Second, we love this travel system... Third, I figured out how to make the travel system even better for the early months when the baby isn't big enough to use the actual stroller alone and when mom is still recovering from child birth and every extra pound makes a difference when lifting.Here's what I did, I took the seat completely off the stroller and used the frame as a snap and go for the carseat.  The seat is connected with velcro and a few snaps.  The hardest part was taking the quick release handle off because it uses a keyring type of connection, but with a little work it comes off just fine.  The entire process of taking the seat off took 10mins or less.  Putting the seat back on took about the same time or just a little longer since I made sure I put it on correctly.This was awesome for many reasons:1. The carseat still snapped into the frame with no problems, because the clips are connected directly to the frame2. The stroller is lighter (at least a pound or two)!  This made a huge difference for me being able to lift it in and out of the car3. The basket underneath is so much more useful. You can throw a huge bag in there because the seat is no longer in the way.  We were also able to put folding chairs over the basket for a day in the park and the stroller held up great4. Takes up less space in the trunk because the middle of the folded stroller is now a space you can put other things (instead of putting things on top of the seat that was there)We have since put the seat back on the stroller because the baby is now able to use the stroller without the carseat, but consider this option for the early months.  It saves you the money of buying a snap and go if you were considering that.  Also, this way is much sturdier than a snap and go, because you still get all the great features of the B-Agile including its quick fold.Happy Strolling!!!   \n",
